			<h1>WELCOME TO THE FUTURE...</h1>
			<h2>...where artificial intelligence has upended society...</h2>

			<p>
				Scandroid is the latest project by multi-instrumentalist artist, producer, songwriter, performer, programmer, and remixer Klayton. Having performed across a multitude of genres as Dred, Deathwish, Circle of Dust and most notably <strong>CELLDWELLER</strong>, Klayton entered synthwave in 2013 and last year produced his first album in the genre, the self-titled '<strong>SCANDROID</strong>'.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scandroid is atmospheric, energetic and deeply immersed in the science-fiction elements synthwave fans will love. The vocals are excellent, the melodies inspiring, and the lyrics catchy and thought-provoking. No matter what alias he produces under, Scandroid / Klayton / Celldweller is an accomplished producer who is clearly at the top of his game!

				But don't just take it from me. Listen for yourself!
